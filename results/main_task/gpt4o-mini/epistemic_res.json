      "The premise states that the patient initially thought her symptoms (persistent cough and weight loss) were due to seasonal allergies, but further investigation uncovered a serious condition (adenocarcinoma).

      "The premise provides information that the patient reported her cough and weight loss to be due to seasonal allergies, but further medical evaluation indicated a serious condition (lung cancer) as the actual cause.

      "The premise provides information suggesting that the patient initially attributed her symptoms (persistent cough and weight loss) to seasonal allergies.
