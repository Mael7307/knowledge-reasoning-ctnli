The combination of cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), with cisplatin, a chemotherapy agent, has been shown to be effective in several clinical trials for this type of cancer.\n\nTherefore, based on the treatment regimen described in the premise and the known effectiveness of such regimens, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement \"The patient is expected to show partial regression of the tumor, with a favorable clinical response and improved progression-free survival\" entailment the premise. \n\nSince all components of the statement are consistent with what we know about this specific treatment regimen, we can also conclude that the statement is entailed by the premise.\n\nOutput: entailment",

The effectiveness of the treatment, as stated by the statement, seems to be dependent on the patient's age (45 years), which may not necessarily correlate with the cancer type or stage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the premise does not seem to be a sufficient condition for the statement.
