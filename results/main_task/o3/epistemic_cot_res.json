      "Step-by-step reasoning\n\n1. Addison’s disease is primary adrenal insufficiency.  \n   Cardinal clinical / laboratory features include:  \n   – Low serum cortisol  \n   – Compensatory high ACTH concentration  \n   – Hyperpigmentation (from excess ACTH/M­SH)  \n   – Hypotension and fatigue\n\n2. Premise facts:  \n   • “Low cortisol” ✔  \n   • “Elevated ACTH” ✔  \n   • “Hyperpigmentation” ✔  \n   • “Hypotension” and “worsening fatigue” ✔\n\n3. A set of findings that exactly matches the defining picture of primary adrenal insufficiency logically implies that the patient has Addison’s disease, regardless of the physician’s (incorrect) recorded diagnosis of depression.\n\n4. There is no information in the premise that rules out Addison’s disease; instead, the findings positively establish it. Therefore, in every world where the premise is true, the statement “The patient has Addison’s disease” is also true.\n\nConclusion: the statement is supported by (entailed by) the premise.\n\noutput: entailment",

      "Step-by-step reasoning  \n\n1. Addison’s disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) classically presents with  \n   • fatigue and weakness  \n   • hypotension  \n   • diffuse hyperpigmentation  \n   • laboratory pattern of low serum cortisol together with elevated ACTH.  \n\n2. The premise says the patient has exactly these clinical signs (fatigue, hypotension, hyperpigmentation) and this laboratory pattern (low cortisol, high ACTH).\n\n3. Therefore, from the information in the premise plus routine medical knowledge, the most direct diagnosis that fits is Addison’s disease.\n\n4. The fact that the physician labeled the condition “depression” does not negate the objective findings; the findings themselves make Addison’s disease a warranted conclusion.\n\n5. Thus the statement “The patient has Addison’s disease” is fully supported by the premise.\n\noutput: entailment",
      "Step-1: Identify the key medical facts in the premise  \n– Symptoms: worsening fatigue, hypotension, hyperpigmentation.  \n– Laboratory data: low cortisol level, elevated ACTH level.\n\nStep-2: Recall relevant medical knowledge  \n– Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) is characterized by destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal cortex, leading to ↓cortisol and a compensatory ↑ACTH.  \n– Chronic ↑ACTH causes skin hyperpigmentation.  \n– Fatigue and hypotension are classic clinical manifestations.  \nTherefore, the constellation “low cortisol + high ACTH + hyperpigmentation” is essentially diagnostic for Addison’s disease.\n\nStep-3: Compare to the physician’s stated diagnosis  \n– The physician’s label of “depression” is clearly inconsistent with the objective findings, but that error does not alter the physiologic facts given in the premise.\n\nStep-4: Determine logical relation  \n– Given the objective data, it necessarily follows that the patient has Addison’s disease, even though the doctor failed to recognize it.  \n– Hence the statement “The patient has Addison’s disease” is logically entailed by the premise.\n\noutput: entailment",
      "Step-by-step reasoning  \n1. The premise describes the patient’s symptoms (fatigue, hypotension, hyper-pigmentation) and laboratory data (low cortisol, elevated ACTH).  \n2. These findings are compatible with Addison’s disease (primary adrenal insufficiency), but the premise never explicitly says the patient has that condition.  \n3. Instead, the premise explicitly says the physician diagnoses the patient with depression and prescribes SSRIs.  \n4. A diagnosis of depression does not rule out Addison’s disease, so there is no direct contradiction.  \n5. Because the premise does not explicitly confirm (nor explicitly deny) Addison’s disease, the statement “The patient has Addison's disease” is not guaranteed by the information given.  \n\nTherefore, the relationship between the premise and the statement is neutral.  \noutput: neutral",
      "Step-by-step reasoning  \n1. Identify the key facts in the premise.  \n   • Fatigue, hypotension, skin hyperpigmentation.  \n   • Laboratory: low cortisol, elevated ACTH.  \n   • The doctor’s recorded diagnosis = depression treated with SSRIs.  \n\n2. Recall what Addison’s disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) looks like.  \n   • Classic triad: fatigue, hypotension, hyperpigmentation.  \n   • Lab hallmark: low cortisol, high ACTH.  \n\n3. Compare premise with statement.  \n   • The clinical picture and labs are certainly consistent with Addison’s disease.  \n   • However, the premise never explicitly says “the patient has Addison’s disease.”  \n   • In fact, it explicitly reports a different diagnosis (depression).  \n\n4. Determine entailment status.  \n   • Because the premise does not state the patient has Addison’s disease and even gives an alternative diagnosis, we cannot be sure the patient truly has Addison’s.  \n   • The information makes the statement plausible, but not guaranteed true.  \n   • Therefore the relationship is “neutral,” not entailment or contradiction.  \n\noutput: neutral",
