Therefore the statement follows directly from the premise.\n\noutput: entailment",
      "Step-by-step reasoning  \n1. The premise lists the number and percentage of patients who experienced each adverse event out of 80 patients.  \n   • Fatigue: 25/80 = 31.25%  \n   • Respiratory distress: 5/80 = 6.25%  \n   • Hypotension: 4/80 = 5.00%  \n   • Diarrhea: 4/80 = 5.00%  \n   • Anaphylaxis: 3/80 = 3.75%  \n   • Rash: 3/80 = 3.75%  \n\n2. “Highest patient risk” can be interpreted as the adverse event with the highest incidence (largest percentage).  \n\n3. Fatigue, at 31.25%, is the largest percentage among all adverse events listed.  \n\n4. Therefore, the statement “The highest patient risk was associated with the occurrence of fatigue” is fully supported by the numbers in the premise.  \n\noutput: entailment",
      "Step-by-step reasoning  \n1. The premise lists the frequencies of several adverse events among 80 patients.  \n   • Fatigue occurred in 25 of 80 patients (31.25%).  \n   • Each other specific event occurred in far fewer patients (≤ 6.25%).  \n\n2. “Patient risk” for an event is naturally interpreted as the proportion of patients who experienced that event. The higher the proportion, the higher the risk of that event for the patient population.  \n\n3. Because fatigue has the largest proportion (31.25%) of all listed events, it represents the highest risk among the specific adverse events reported.  \n\n4. The statement — “The highest patient risk was associated with the occurrence of fatigue.” — exactly matches what the data show.  \n\nTherefore, the statement is supported by the premise.  \noutput: entailment",
      "Step-1: Identify the relevant numbers in the premise.  \n• Fatigue: 25/80 patients → 31.25%  \n• Anaphylaxis: 3/80 patients → 3.75%  \n• Respiratory distress: 5/80 patients → 6.25%  \n• Hypotension: 4/80 patients → 5.00%  \n• Diarrhea: 4/80 patients → 5.00%  \n• Rash: 3/80 patients → 3.75%\n\nStep-2: Compare the percentages.  \n31.25% (fatigue) is higher than every other listed adverse-event percentage (all ≤ 6.25%).\n\nStep-3: Interpret the statement.  \n“The highest patient risk was associated with the occurrence of fatigue” means fatigue was the most common (highest-risk) specific adverse event.\n\nStep-4: Draw the relation.  \nBecause fatigue indeed has the highest percentage of patients affected, the statement is directly supported by the data in the premise.\n\noutput: entailment"
