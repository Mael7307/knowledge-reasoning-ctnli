This suggests a relationship where dry mouth might be considered a significant or major risk.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the statement is entailed by the premise since the occurrence of dry mouth is indeed associated with one of the highest rates among the listed adverse events.\n\noutput: entailment"
