The premise mentions that 33 participants were analyzed, but there's no mention of a control group or a comparison to another treatment or placebo. \n\nIn clinical trials, to establish effectiveness, especially for a medication, you typically need a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where the treatment group is compared to a control group.
