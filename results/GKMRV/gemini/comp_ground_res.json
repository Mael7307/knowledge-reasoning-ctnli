The 200mg dose is the standard adult flat dose and represents a massive overdose (approximately 16-25 times the correct dose) for an infant.

Hepatotoxicity (liver injury), manifested as elevated liver transaminases, is also a well-documented side effect of gemcitabine that would be significantly worsened by such an intense, high-dose schedule.

A daily dosing schedule does not allow for bone marrow recovery between doses, which would lead to profound and potentially life-threatening neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Liver enzyme elevation (liver injury) is also a known side effect that would be exacerbated by such an intensive, high-dose schedule. Early clinical trials exploring daily gemcitabine schedules found the maximum tolerated dose to be much lower than 1250 mg/m² due to severe hematologic toxicity.
