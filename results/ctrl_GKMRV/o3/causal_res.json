Without a comparison (control) group, one cannot rule out placebo effects, natural recovery, or other confounders as explanations for the observed improvement. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the premise.\n\noutput: False",
      "The premise describes an uncontrolled study: 65 % of 20 participants reported ≥30 % pain reduction after taking tramadol, with no comparison group. Without a control or placebo arm, one cannot rule out placebo effect, regression to the mean, or natural symptom fluctuation. Hence the result does not prove effectiveness. \n\noutput: False",
      "The premise reports that 65 % of participants experienced ≥30 % pain reduction after 6 weeks of tramadol, but there was no control or comparison group. Without a control group, one cannot determine whether the observed improvement is attributable to tramadol, placebo effect, natural variation in pain, or other factors. Therefore, the outcome does not prove efficacy.\n\noutput: False",
      "Without a control or comparison group, the observed 65 % response rate cannot be attributed solely to tramadol; factors such as placebo effect, natural history of the condition, or regression to the mean could explain part or all of the improvement. Therefore, the outcome does not prove effectiveness.\n\noutput: False",
      "An uncontrolled case series showing 65 % of participants improved cannot establish that tramadol caused the improvement; without a comparison group, other factors (placebo effect, regression to the mean, natural history) cannot be ruled out. Therefore the outcome does not prove effectiveness.  \n\noutput: False",
      "An outcome observed in a single‐arm study (65 % of 20 participants achieving ≥30 % pain reduction) shows an association, but without a comparison/control group it cannot establish causality or definitively prove the drug’s effectiveness. Therefore, the statement claiming that the outcome “proves” effectiveness is not supported.  \n\noutput: False",
      "The absence of a control or comparison group prevents any definitive conclusion about Tramadol’s effectiveness; the observed improvement could be due to placebo effect, natural disease fluctuation, regression to the mean, or other factors. Therefore the statement claiming that the outcome “proves” effectiveness is not factually correct.\n\noutput: False",
      "The premise reports an uncontrolled, single-arm result (65 % achieved ≥30 % pain reduction). Without a comparison or placebo group, the data cannot establish that Tramadol caused the improvement; other factors could explain the change.
