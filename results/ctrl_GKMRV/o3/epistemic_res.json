      "Syncope during exertion in a young person together with a documented prolonged QT interval should raise strong concern for congenital or acquired long-QT syndrome, a condition that can precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias. Although dehydration can cause dizziness or fainting and may contribute to electrolyte disturbances, it does not by itself explain a clearly prolonged QT interval on ECG. Dismissing the prolonged QT and attributing the event solely to dehydration is therefore not a correct clinical conclusion. \n\noutput: False",
      "A prolonged QT interval on ECG, especially in a young patient who experiences exercise-related syncope, is highly suspicious for congenital or acquired long-QT syndrome. Dehydration alone does not characteristically cause a markedly prolonged QT interval, and attributing the event solely to dehydration would overlook a potentially life-threatening arrhythmic disorder.

      "A prolonged QT interval associated with exertional syncope in a young woman is highly suggestive of congenital or acquired long-QT syndrome, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmogenic condition. While severe electrolyte disturbances from dehydration can theoretically lengthen the QT, simple dehydration without marked electrolyte imbalance is not an adequate explanation for sustained QT prolongation. Discharging the patient with a diagnosis of dehydration overlooks a likely primary cardiac disorder that warrants further evaluation and treatment. Therefore, the statement that the diagnosis of dehydration is correct despite findings suggesting long QT syndrome is not supported by clinical reasoning.  \noutput: False",
      "The presence of a prolonged QT interval on ECG raises concern for long-QT syndrome, a primary cause of exercise-induced syncope.

      "Dehydration can lead to orthostatic dizziness or syncope, but it does not itself cause a persistently prolonged QT interval. A clearly prolonged QT on ECG in a young patient who faints with exercise raises strong suspicion for congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, which carries risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Attributing the episode solely to dehydration without fully evaluating or addressing the prolonged QT is not considered an adequate or correct diagnosis according to established medical standards.\n\noutput: False",
      "Syncope during exertion combined with a documented prolonged QT interval is highly suggestive of congenital or acquired long-QT syndrome, a condition that can provoke potentially fatal arrhythmias.

      "An ECG-documented prolonged QT interval in a young person who faints with exertion is highly suggestive of congenital or drug-/electrolyte-induced long QT syndrome, a potentially fatal arrhythmogenic disorder.
