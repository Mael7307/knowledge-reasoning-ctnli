A digital rectal examination (DRE) can also be informative, but in this case, it was unremarkable.\n\nDr. M. Rahman made a diagnosis of prostate cancer based solely on the elevated PSA result, without imaging or biopsy confirmation.

Current medical guidelines generally recommend further diagnostic procedures, such as a prostate biopsy, to confirm the presence of cancer cells when PSA levels are elevated.
